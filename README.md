# Hue Effects server

Most of the effects for HUE lights seem to be iOS/Android app based, most of them are not free.

This is a little webserver that allows you to start and stop a effects on several hue lights.

No credit to me, 99% of the code (all the effects) was generated by ChatGPT.

* Run `npm i` to install the dependencies
* Create a user with the `node hue-create-user.js` script
* Put the generated username in config.json along with your Hue Bridge IP
* Run `node hue-effects.js` to start the embedded web server
* Make a call to `http://localhost:8080/start?lights=2,4,5&effect=lightning` to start the lightning effect on these lights
* Make a call to `http://localhost:8080/stop?hash=UUID` to stop the effect and turn off your lights

### Supported effects

* Lightning
* Undervoltage
* Police lights
* Party mode
* Strobe

### TODO / ideas

* Create a docker image for more convenient usage
* Add more effect customization (most intervals, delays and number of iterations are now hardcoded inside an effect)
* Add scheduling (based on crons + durations?)
* Launch an effect on a set of lights through UI (?)
